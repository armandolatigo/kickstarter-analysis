# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

#### Analysis of acquired Kickstarter campaign data across the global entertainment industry with specific interest in live performance theater to inform the client's decision to begin their own Kickstarter campaign in the United States\

### Purpose

#### To arrive at a decision whether or not to pursue a theater campaign on Kickstarter given the data collected

### Analysis and Challenges
#### Sorting data via filters and pivot tables to analyze campaigns in the US using data categorized by failed, successful, and canceled

### Functions:
- YEAR()
- Epoch Time Conversion: (((timestamp/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)
- Countifs(), Vlookup()
- Average(), Median(), Mode ()
- Stdev.p(), Quartile.exc()
- IFERROR()

#### Visually communicating failed, successful, cancelled campaigns in the US with bar graphs for Parent Category (theater) and sub category (plays)
#### Line graph communicating time frame of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns 
#### Outcomes based on goal amount
#### Outcomes based on launch date timeframe

### Challenges: 
#### Getting the y and x axis to correctly populate necessary fields to show the desired values
#### Understanding Variance and Standard Deviation
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### Sorting through the data using pivot tables to narrow in on Theater campaigns in the United States and using graphs to visually communicate them

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### Seeing the outcomes in relation to the amount needed to fund the campaign to or exceeding 100%

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Getting the Y and X axis to display the correct measured fields in the Outcomes based on goals graph, 
#### Had to manually select data set in Mac OS as opposed to easily selecting data on Windows Excel

### Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Best time to launch a successful campaign would be end of April
2. The Fall and Winter would be least recommended time to launch a campaign

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Most successful campaigns had a goal of around $5,000 or less
2. Campaigns tend to fail most around $45000 or more

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. This data is set over a time frame of roughly 8 years
2. No data on Average Income of backers 
3. No data on outreach to advertise/market Kickstarters  

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
#### Involving spotlight would've showed which plays would've likely had been marketed more or received more 'buzz' to
